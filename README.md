## Auto File Sending Telegram Bot Using Python

### AIM: To send multiple files on Telegram from a folder with one click of your finger.

This bot helps me send my files to telegram with an automation process.
It can send multiple files with a custom thumbnail and captions for each file and also customize the messages with a signature.

I use this bot to save movies and series on telegram to share with friends or to watch later.
For a given series the bot sends season by season separating with a season number sticker which keeps it well organized.

### Scope:
Can send a large number of files(like video, zip, etc) with ease by saving the trouble for you of sending one file at a time.
